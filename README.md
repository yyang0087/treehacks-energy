Submission for TreeHacks 2018 - Stem's Challenge.

## [Challenge](https://github.com/stemtreehacks/stem_treehacks_2018)
To forecast one site's energy consumption and simulate the activity of a behind-the-meter energy storage system in order to reduce this client's energy bill through peak shaving.


## Our Solution
[Learning](https://github.com/yyang0087/treehacks-energy/blob/master/1.png)

As the train decreases over epoch, it's evident that the model is learning.
```
Train Score: 44.57 RMSE
Test Score: 46.17 RMSE
```
Since train and test scores are close, the model can correctly predict on data it hasn't seen yet.
